 *   Group Project
 * 
 *      25. Travel Expenses
 * 
 *          This program should be designed and written by a 
 *      team of students. Here are some suggestions:
 * 
 *      • One student should design function main, which will 
 *        call the other functions in the pro- gram. The 
 *        remainder of the functions will be designed by other 
 *        members of the team.
 *      
 *      • The requirements of the program should be analyzed 
 *        so each student is given about the same workload.
 * 
 *      • The parameters and return types of each function 
 *        should be decided in advance.
 * 
 *      • Stubs and drivers should be used to test and debug 
 *        the program.
 *  
 *      • The program can be implemented as a multifile 
 *        program, or all the functions can be cut and 
 *        pasted into the main file.
 * 
 *          Here is the assignment: Write a program that 
 *      calculates and displays the total travel expenses of 
 *      a businessperson on a trip. The program should have 
 *      functions that ask for and return the following:
 * 
 *      • The total number of days spent on the trip
 *      • The time of departure on the first day of the 
 *        trip, and the time of arrival back home on the 
 *        last day of the trip
 *      • The amount of any round-trip airfare
 *      • The amount of any car rentals
 *      • Miles driven, if a private vehicle was used. 
 *        Calculate the vehicle expense as $0.27 per mile 
 *        driven
 *      • Parking fees (The company allows up to $6 per day. 
 *        Anything in excess of this must be paid by the 
 *        employee.)
 *      • Taxi fees, if a taxi was used anytime during the 
 *        trip (The company allows up to $10 per day, for 
 *        each day a taxi was used. Anything in excess of 
 *        this must be paid by the employee.)
 *      • Conference or seminar registration fees
 *      • Hotel expenses (The company allows up to $90 per 
 *        night for lodging. Anything in excess of this must 
 *        be paid by the employee.)
 *      • The amount of each meal eaten. On the first day of 
 *        the trip, breakfast is allowed as an expense if the 
 *        time of departure is before 7 a.m. Lunch is allowed 
 *        if the time of departure is before 12 noon. Dinner 
 *        is allowed on the first day if the time of departure 
 *        is before 6 p.m. On the last day of the trip, breakfast 
 *        is allowed if the time of arrival is after 8 a.m. 
 *        Lunch is allowed if the time of arrival is after 1 p.m. 
 *        Dinner is allowed on the last day if the time of 
 *        arrival is after 7 p.m. The program should only ask 
 *        for the amounts of allowable meals. (The company 
 *        allows up to $9 for breakfast, $12 for lunch, and 
 *        $16 for dinner. Anything in excess of this must be 
 *        paid by the employee.)
 * 
 *          The program should calculate and display the total 
 *      expenses incurred by the busi- nessperson, the total 
 *      allowable expenses for the trip, the excess that must 
 *      be reimbursed by the businessperson, if any, and the 
 *      amount saved by the businessperson if the expenses were 
 *      under the total allowed.
 * 
 *      Input Validation: Do not accept negative numbers for 
 *                        any dollar amount or for miles driven 
 *                        in a private vehicle. Do not accept 
 *                        numbers less than 1 for the number of 
 *                        days. Only accept valid times for the 
 *                        time of departure and the time of 
 *                        arrival.
