8.1 Discribe the difference between the linear search and the binary search.
ANSWER: Instead of testing the array's first element, like linear search, 
        the binary search algorithm starts with the element in the middle.
        Also, unlike binary search, linear search doesn't require the data
        in the array to be stored in any particular order.

8.2 On average, with an array of 20,000 elements, how many comparisons will the 
    linear search perform? (Assume the items being searched for are consistently 
    found in the array.)     
ANSWER: N/2 is the average number of comparisons.

8.3 With an array of 20,000 elements, what is the maximum number of comparisons
the binary search will perform?
ANSWER: The maximum number of comparisons is 15 as in 2^15.

8.4 If a linear search is performed on an array, and it is known that some 
    items are searched for more frequently than others, how can the contents 
    of the array be reordered to improve the average performance of the search?
ANSWER: To improve the average performance of a linear search, I would move the
        more frequently searched items to the front of the array. This would allow
        less iterations to occur since the frequently searched items are at the front
        of the array.
