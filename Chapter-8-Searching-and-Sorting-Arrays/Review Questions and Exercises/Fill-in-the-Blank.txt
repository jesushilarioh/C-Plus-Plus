8. The __linear__ search algorithm steps sequentially through 
an array, comparing each item with the search value.

9. The __binary__ search algorithm repeatedly divides the 
portion of an array being searched in half.

10. The __linear__ search algorithm is adequate for small
arrays but not large arrays.

11. The __binary__ search algorithm requires that the
array's contents be sorted.

12. If an array is sorted in __ascending__ order, the 
values are stored from lowest to highest.

13. If an array is sorted in __descending__ order, the
values are stored from highest to lowest.
