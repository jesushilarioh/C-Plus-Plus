/**
 * 3. Word Counter
 * 
 * Write a function that accepts a pointer to 
 * a C-string as an argument and returns the number 
 * of words contained in the string. For instance, 
 * if the string argument is “Four score and seven 
 * years ago” the function should return the number 
 * 6. Demonstrate the function in a program that 
 * asks the user to input a string and then passes 
 * it to the function. The number of words in the 
 * string should be displayed on the screen. 
 * Optional Exercise: Write an overloaded version of this 
 * function that accepts a string class object as its 
 * argument.
