 * Write a function that returns an integer and 
 * accepts a pointer to a C-string as an argument. 
 * The function should count the number of characters 
 * in the string and return that number. Demonstrate 
 * the function in a simple program that asks the user 
 * to input a string, passes it to the function, and 
 * then displays the functionâ€™s return value.
