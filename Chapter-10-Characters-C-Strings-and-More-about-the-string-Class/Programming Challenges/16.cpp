 * 16. Pig Latin
 * 
 * Write a program that reads a sentence as input 
 * and converts each word to “Pig Latin.” In one 
 * version, to convert a word to Pig Latin you remove 
 * the first letter and place that letter at the end 
 * of the word. Then you append the string “ay” to 
 * the word. Here is an example:
 * 
 * English: I SLEPT MOST OF THE NIGHT
 * Pig Latin: IAY LEPTSAY OSTMAY FOAY HETAY IGHTNAY
