/**
 * 2. Backward String
 * Write a function that accepts a pointer 
 * to a C-string as an argument and displays 
 * its contents backward. For instance, if the 
 * string argument is “Gravity” the function should 
 * display “ytivarG”. Demonstrate the function in 
 * a program that asks the user to input a string 
 * and then passes it to the function.
