/**
 * Case Manipulator
 * 
 * Write a program with three functions: upper, lower, 
 * and reverse. The upper function should accept a 
 * pointer to a C-string as an argument. It should 
 * step through each char- acter in the string, converting 
 * it to uppercase. The lower function, too, should accept 
 * a pointer to a C-string as an argument. It should step 
 * through each character in the string, converting it to 
 * lowercase. Like upper and lower, reverse should also 
 * accept a pointer to a string. As it steps through the 
 * string, it should test each character to determine 
 * whether it is upper- or lowercase. If a character is 
 * uppercase, it should be converted to lowercase. Likewise, 
 * if a character is lowercase, it should be converted to 
 * uppercase.
 * 
 * Test the functions by asking for a string in function 
 * main, then passing it to them in the following order: 
 * reverse, lower, and upper.
 *
