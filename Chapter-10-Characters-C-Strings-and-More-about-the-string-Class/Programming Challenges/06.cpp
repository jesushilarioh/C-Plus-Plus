/**
 * 6. Vowels and Consonants
 * 
 * Write a function that accepts a pointer to a C-string as its argument. 
 * The function should count the number of vowels appearing in the string 
 * and return that number.
 * Write another function that accepts a pointer to a C-string as its 
 * argument. This func- tion should count the number of consonants 
 * appearing in the string and return that number.
 * 
 * Demonstrate these two functions in a program that performs the following steps:
 * 
 * 1. The user is asked to enter a string.
 * 
 * 2. The program displays the following menu:
 *  A) Count the number of vowels in the string
 *  B) Count the number of consonants in the string
 *  C) Count both the vowels and consonants in the string D) Enter another string
 *  E) Exit the program
 * 
 * 3. The program performs the operation selected by the user and repeats until 
 * the user selects E to exit the program.
