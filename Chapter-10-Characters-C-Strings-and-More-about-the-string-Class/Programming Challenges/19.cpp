/**
 * 
 * 19. Check Writer
 * 
 * Write a program that displays a simulated paycheck. 
 * The program should ask the user to enter the date, 
 * the payeeâ€™s name, and the amount of the check (up 
 * to $10,000). It should then display a simulated 
 * check with the dollar amount spelled out, as shown 
 * here:
 * 
 *                                      Date: 11/24/2014
 * 
 * 
 * Pay to the Order of: John Phillips           $1920.85 
 * 
 * One thousand nine hundred twenty and 85 cents
 * 
 * 
 * Be sure to format the numeric value of the check 
 * in fixed-point notation with two decimal places of 
 * precision. Be sure the decimal place always displays, 
 * even when the number is zero or has no fractional part. 
 * Use either C-strings or string class objects in this 
 * program.
 * 
 * Input Validation: Do not accept negative dollar 
 * amounts, or amounts over $10,000.
