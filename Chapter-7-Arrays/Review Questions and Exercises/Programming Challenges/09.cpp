/************************************************************
 *
 *   09. Payroll
 * 
 *  Write a program that uses the following arrays:
 * 
 * • empId: an array of seven long integers to hold 
 * employee identification numbers. The array should be 
 * initialized with the following numbers:
 * 
 * 5658845 4520125 7895122 8777541 8451277 1302850 7580489
 * 
 * • hours: an array of seven integers to hold the number 
 * of hours worked by each employee
 * 
 * • payRate: an array of seven doubles to hold each 
 * employee’s hourly pay rate
 * 
 * • wages: an array of seven doubles to hold each 
 * employee’s gross wages
 * 
 * The program should relate the data in each array 
 * through the subscripts. For example, the number in 
 * element 0 of the hours array should be the number 
 * of hours worked by the employee whose identification 
 * number is stored in element 0 of the empId array.
 * That same employee’s pay rate should be stored in 
 * element 0 of the payRate array.
 * 
 * The program should display each employee number and 
 * ask the user to enter that employee’s hours and pay 
 * rate. It should then calculate the gross wages for that 
 * employee (hours times pay rate) and store them in the 
 * wages array. After the data has been entered for all the 
 * employees, the program should display each employee’s 
 * identification number and gross wages.
 * 
 * Input Validation: Do not accept negative values for 
 * hours or numbers less than 15.00 for pay rate.
